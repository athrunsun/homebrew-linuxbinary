    def caveats; <<~EOS
        Executable is linked as "jbtool".
        
        Known issue:
        Jetbrains Toolbox is able to update itself, but once you do that,
            new executable will be installed as "~/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/bin/jetbrains-toolbox",
            with a desktop entry "~/.local/share/applications/jetbrains-toolbox.desktop".
        So once you did the update, use the "*.desktop" entry (which is usually accessed in application menu of your 
            desktop) to launch toolbox, instead of executing "jbtool" (which is still the old version).

        Tips:
        Find your Jetbrains applications (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) in "~/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps", where you can remove older versions manually.
